# go-op-cli
A wrapper for the 1Password CLI (`op`), which will improve implementation of 1Password-based authentication in Go projects.  

## When will it be ready?
Soonâ„¢

## Credit
Some pieces taken from or inspired from the following repo: <github.com/dvcrn/go-1password-cli>  

I decided to make my own as opposed to forking it, as this is one of my first Go projects and I wanted the practice of making it from scratch. Thank you for the great starting point!
